The user interacts through a menu in the terminal,
 choosing actions like “add task,” “view tasks,”
  or “delete task.” The program stores all tasks in memory while running,
   and whenever the user exits, it writes them into a text file. When the program starts again,
    it reads that file and loads all the previous tasks back in.
